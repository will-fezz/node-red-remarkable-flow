# ðŸ“š Node-RED EPUB to PDF Workflow for reMarkable

This repository contains a Node-RED flow designed to automate the process of delivering EPUB and PDF files to your reMarkable tablet via email.

## âœ¨ Features

- Accepts EPUB and PDF files via email
- Converts EPUB files to PDF using `epub_to_remarkable`
- Routes files based on subject line:
  - `Send to reMarkable` â†’ pushed to reMarkable via Aviary
  - `Send to eReader` â†’ saved to Kavita directory
- Uses FileBrowser to store temporary files
- Automatically deletes temporary files after processing
- Fully self-hosted using Docker

## ðŸ›  Requirements

Youâ€™ll need the following services running locally (Docker recommended):

| Service | GitHub | Port | Notes |
|--------|--------|------|-------|
| Node-RED | https://github.com/node-red/node-red | `1880` | Core automation |
| epub_to_remarkable | https://github.com/suntorytimed/epub_to_remarkable | `5004` | Converts EPUB to PDF |
